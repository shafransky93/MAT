# TODO
- Actual testing of software (right now, testing on a potato)
- - Metricize results
- - Compare to other training methods
- Chat program for models once trained
- Hyperparameterization
- User Interface
- Generalize tokenization to broader datatypes
- Attach to search API


# M.A.T.
Welcome to the cybernetic world of text manipulation! This repository houses a formidable ensemble of cybernetic soldiers, Python scripts that can define and train Transformer models with precision and accuracy. These soldiers have been trained to generate new text and classify input sequences using the robust Transformer architecture. They were crafted with a relentless focus on data preprocessing, masking input sequences, and creating padding and look-ahead masks to ensure optimal performance.

The heart of this repository is built on the Keras API, and it will surely blow your mind with its stunning capabilities. The training progress is displayed with the sleek and stylish Matplotlib, a true aesthetic marvel.

If you're looking for a starting point to build your own custom Transformer models for text-based applications in the neon-lit dystopia of tomorrow, look no further. These soldiers have been tested and optimized for the most challenging cyber scenarios, ready to tackle any challenge you throw their way. The future is now, and it's time to join the revolution.
